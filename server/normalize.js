 * Input normalisation for the explanation layer.
 *
 * Real people do not type clean sentences, and speech recognition is worse
 * than they are. "whyy this supllier choosen", "summrize ths", "uhh can you
 * tell me why we picked supplier a" all mean something obvious to a human and
 * nothing at all to a substring match. This module closes that gap before any
 * classification happens.
 *
 * Deliberately no dependency and no model call. Normalisation runs on every
 * question including the ones that end up refused, so it has to be fast and it
 * has to be deterministic. A network round trip here would put a language model
 * upstream of the capability boundary, which is exactly the wrong side of it.
 *
 * The rule throughout: repair spelling and noise, never meaning. Nothing here
 * may add, drop or invert a word that changes what was asked. Corrections are
 * only applied against a fixed vocabulary of terms this product actually uses,
 * so an unrecognised word is left exactly as typed rather than being "fixed"
 * into something the person did not say.

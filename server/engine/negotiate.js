   * The mirror of the ceiling assertion above, and the reason it is here rather

   *
   * Line 94 asserts the agent never offers above the buyer's authorised
   * ceiling. Everything below it bounds the supplier's side, so the symmetric
   * claim - that a settlement never lands under the supplier's floor - is just
   * as load-bearing and had no assertion at all. It happened to hold, because
   * both acceptance branches compare against minAcceptable. "Happens to hold"
   * is what the ceiling invariant would also have been without line 94, and the
   * whole argument of this product is that the two sides are enforced the same
   * way.
   *
   * Two floors, deliberately:
   *
   *   floorUnitPrice  the supplier's real cost line. This is the number that
   *                   becomes minUnitPrice in ProcurementEscrow, so a settlement
   *                   under it is not a bad deal, it is a transaction the chain
   *                   would refuse at funding time. Catching it here turns a
   *                   revert the person cannot read into a crash we can.
   *
   *   minAcceptable   cost plus the margin the supplier negotiates for, and the
   *                   expedite surcharge if the buyer asked for speed. A
   *                   settlement under this means the simulated supplier
   *                   accepted something it was programmed to refuse.
   *
   * Both are private to the supplier, which is why this check belongs to the
   * engine and not to the agent: the agent cannot see either number, and that
   * asymmetry is the point of negotiating at all.

/// @title ProcurementEscrow
/// @notice Stablecoin escrow for agent-negotiated procurement, with an on-chain
///         spending policy that bounds what an autonomous agent is allowed to commit.
///
/// @dev Three properties do real work here and are the reason this is on-chain at all:
///
///      1. SEPARATION OF AUTHORITY. The buyer and the agent are different addresses.
///         The buyer alone can write a policy. The agent alone can spend under it.
///         An agent holding its own key cannot widen its own mandate, because
///         setAgentPolicy keys off msg.sender - the buyer - and there is no path
///         from createDeal to policy mutation. This is the difference between
///         "we promise the agent won't overspend" and "the agent cannot".
///
///      2. AGENT SPENDING POLICY. The buyer publishes limits (per-deal cap, cumulative
///         cap, expiry) as contract state. Any deal the agent opens is checked against
///         those limits by the EVM. A buggy, jailbroken or hallucinating agent cannot
///         exceed them, because the ceiling is not enforced in the agent's own code -
///         it is enforced by a contract the agent cannot edit.
///
///      3. SETTLEMENT-BOUND REPUTATION. Reputation is written by this contract, and only
///         on real fund movement. It cannot be purchased, self-reported, or reset by
///         moving to a different marketplace.

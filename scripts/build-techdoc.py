h1("1. Executive summary")
lead("Limen is a procurement agent that takes a plain-language sourcing request, screens a "
     "supplier catalogue against it, negotiates in parallel with the suppliers that qualify, "
     "recommends one deal and settles payment through an escrow contract. It does all of that "
     "on its own.")
p("The one thing it cannot do is decide how much it is allowed to spend. That figure is written "
  "into contract storage by the buyer, and the contract checks it on every purchase. The agent can "
  "be wrong, confused or actively manipulated, and the ceiling still holds.")
pull("The agent can negotiate the deal. It cannot change what it is allowed to spend.")
p("The product runs end to end with no external services: an in-process EVM, a seeded supplier "
  "catalogue and a deterministic procurement engine. A language model is optional and is used only "
  "to reword explanations that are already correct.")

h1("2. Problem statement")
p("Autonomous agents are being given real payment authority faster than the controls around them "
  "are being built. An agent that sources and pays is exposed to supplier text it did not write, "
  "catalogue data it cannot verify, and a model whose behaviour changes between versions.")
p("The usual defence is an instruction: <i>you must never spend more than $1,200</i>. That "
  "instruction arrives through the same channel as the attack, is interpreted by the same model the "
  "attack is targeting, and produces no signal when it fails. It is a request, not a control.")
h2("What has to be true instead")
p("An agent that has been fully compromised, in the sense that an attacker controls every "
  "instruction it receives and every transaction it signs, still must not be able to move more than "
  "the buyer's per-deal ceiling. That has to hold without any check in the application layer, "
  "because the application layer is not the thing enforcing it.")

h1("3. Proposed solution")
p("Limen separates the party that negotiates from the party that authorises. The buyer writes a "
  "per-deal ceiling into the escrow contract. The agent works beneath it and never holds the pen.")
table([
    ["Identity", "Holds", "Can do"],

    ["Agent", "Account 10", "Screen, negotiate, recommend, submit purchases under the ceiling."],
], [24 * mm, 24 * mm, FW - 48 * mm])
p("The separation is structural rather than procedural. The escrow contract writes an agent policy "
  "keyed on the caller:")
code("function setAgentPolicy(address agent, uint128 maxPerDeal,\n"
     "                       uint128 maxTotal, uint64 expiry) external {\n"
     "    // the record written is always policies[msg.sender]\n"
     "}")
p("Because the record is keyed on <font face='Courier' size='8.6'>msg.sender</font>, the only "
  "policy the agent can write is its own. There is no argument it can pass and no sequence of calls "
  "it can make that reaches the buyer's record. This is not an authorisation check that might "
  "contain a bug; the buyer's policy is not addressable from the agent's account.")
p("The demo shows this directly. One button lets the agent raise its own cap to $1,000,000. It "
  "succeeds, and the agent's own policy genuinely changes. The next spend is still rejected, "
  "because <font face='Courier' size='8.6'>createDeal</font> reads the buyer's record.")

  "repairs tokens within one or two edits of a term the product actually uses and leaves anything "
  "unrecognised exactly as typed. It never adds, drops or inverts a word.")

  "after a verb such as <i>raise</i>. During testing the corrector was rewriting "

  "buyer's run is never served to another.")
